Commands:
    directives <path-to-source>
        Generates the function map to inject directives and functionality
        into a Go template based on source code. The provided path can
        point to either a single GO file or an entire package of GO using
        the `-d` flag. Directives are created from any exported function
        that (1) has a name with the "Directive" suffix and (2) returns a
        single payload with an optional error; the directive will share
        the same name (camel-cased) without the suffix.
